# ecommerce-sales-dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of ecommerce sales by showing the profit gained by sales company in a year. Also, the top 4 customers and states who have spent the most are shown using a chart. A summary of profit, quantity, amount and average order value is provided for an overview.<br><br>

Charts used in the dashboard -<br/><br/>
**Donut Chart** - used to show quantity by category and quantity by category in payment mode<br><br>
**Stacked Bar Chart** - used to show the money spent by states. I have chosen the top 4 states who have spent the most. Other than that, I have made a chart that shows the profit according to sub-categories<br><br>
**Stacked Column Chart** - used to show profit by month and money spent by specific customers (top 4)<br><br>

I have used different colours for different sub-categories to make the visualization more attractive. In the profit chart, I have shown the *loss* bars by orange colour and *profit* bars by blue for simpler understanding. Eventually, I have created a section for filters (slicers) to see the profits and other details quarter-wise. Another filter is state based, where we can choose the state from the dropdown list and observe the sales in a specific state or even in multiple states.
